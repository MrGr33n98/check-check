# Logo Implementation Test

This document describes how to test that the logo has been properly implemented in the SolarFinder application.

## Test Steps

### 1. Verify Logo Display
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

3. Check that the logo appears in the top-left corner of the header

4. Verify that the logo:
   - Is properly sized (should be approximately 32px high)
   - Has a transparent background (if using PNG)
   - Is crisp and clear (not pixelated)
   - Loads quickly

### 2. Test Responsive Behavior
1. Resize your browser window to different widths:
   - Desktop (> 1024px)
   - Tablet (768px - 1024px)
   - Mobile (< 768px)

2. Verify that the logo:
   - Maintains proper proportions at all sizes
   - Remains清晰 and readable
   - Doesn't distort or stretch

### 3. Test Mobile Menu
1. On mobile view, click the hamburger menu button

2. Verify that:
   - The logo still appears in the header when menu is open
   - The logo doesn't interfere with menu items
   - The logo maintains proper sizing

### 4. Check Accessibility
1. Inspect the logo element in browser dev tools

2. Verify that:
   - The `img` tag has proper `alt` attribute ("SolarFinder Logo")
   - The logo has appropriate CSS classes for styling
   - The logo is properly positioned within the header

### 5. Test Different Pages
1. Navigate to different pages:
   - Home page
   - Category pages
   - Company detail pages
   - Blog pages

2. Verify that:
   - The logo appears consistently on all pages
   - The logo maintains the same appearance and behavior
   - Clicking the logo returns to the home page

## Expected Results

- Logo should display correctly on all pages and devices
- Logo should be crisp and properly sized
- Logo should have appropriate alt text for accessibility
- Logo should link to the home page
- Logo should maintain consistent appearance across all views

## Troubleshooting

If the logo doesn't display properly:

1. **Check file path**:
   - Ensure `logo.png` exists in `/src/assets/`
   - Verify import path in `Header.tsx`

2. **Check file format**:
   - Ensure file is valid PNG
   - Verify file isn't corrupted

3. **Check CSS classes**:
   - Ensure `h-8 w-auto` classes are applied
   - Verify no conflicting styles

4. **Check browser cache**:
   - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache if needed

5. **Check console errors**:
   - Look for 404 errors related to logo file
   - Check for CSS or JavaScript errors

## Performance Considerations

- Logo file size should be optimized (<50KB)
- Consider using WebP format for better compression
- Implement lazy loading if logo is below the fold
- Use CDN for logo delivery in production

This test ensures that the logo has been properly implemented and will provide a consistent brand experience across all user interactions.
