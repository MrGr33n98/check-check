## Frontend Integration Steps

### 1. Update API Client
In your React frontend, update your API service to point to the Rails backend:
```javascript
// Example API calls
const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1';

// Get all categories
fetch(`${API_BASE}/categories`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));

// Get specific solution
fetch(`${API_BASE}/solutions/1`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));

// Create new lead
fetch(`${API_BASE}/leads`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    lead: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john@example.com',
      phone: '(11) 99999-9999',
      company: 'Solar Company',
      message: 'I am interested in your solution',
      solution_id: 1
    }
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### 2. Authentication Integration
Implement JWT authentication with the Rails backend:
```javascript
// Login
fetch('/api/v1/auth/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: 'user@example.com',
    password: 'password'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  localStorage.setItem('token', data.token);
});
```

### 3. Data Synchronization
Replace your mock data with real API calls:
```javascript
// Replace mockCategories with real API call
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/v1/categories')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(setCategories);
}, []);
```

## Testing the Integration

### API Testing
You can test the API endpoints using curl or Postman:

curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/categories

# Get specific solution
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/solutions/1

# Create new lead
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/leads 
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
  -d '{"lead":{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","phone":"(11) 99999-9999","company":"Solar Company","message":"I am interested in your solution","solution_id":1}}'

# Get all leads
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/leads
```

### Admin Panel Testing
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin`
2. Login with admin credentials
