## Noticed V2
Hi, this is all about [Noticed v2](https://github.com/excid3/noticed) , a remarkable gem developed by [Chris Oliver](https://github.com/excid3)!
This is Working Code! :tada: :rocket:

In case you’re not yet familiar, Noticed V2 is a remarkable gem developed by Chris Oliver. It simplifies the transmission of notifications of various types through different channels to diverse recipients within your application.

This graphic illustrates all the relationships within 
the business and the Noticed v2 models. 

Here are some key points about the graphics I'd like to discuss:

1. Business Tables Relationships:

Users have many posts, and each post belongs to one user.
Posts have many comments, and each comment belongs to one post.
Users also have many comments, and each comment belongs to one user.

2. The Noticed system:

comprises two tables: noticed_notifications table: Which tracks recipients and whether they've seen or read notifications.
noticed_events table: Stores events and comments about what happened, including the type of comments (e.g., bug notes, release notes, improvements notes).
The polymorphic attribute is set to true, allowing a model to belong to multiple parent models. For instance, the Notification model can be associated
with various entities like User, Post, Admin or Comment dynamically.

3. Relationships and Glue Logic:

In the noticed_events table, events belong to records, and in noticed_notifications, records belong to events, creating an augmented relationship.
Recipients, defined in the Users table, are linked to notifications, serving as the glue logic for our business logic framework.

4. Notification Handling:

There are two types of notifications: one directly associated with users and another through delegations to posts.
The Comments table has many 'notification_mentions', connecting to the Noticed library through 'has_noticed_notifications' linked with the Noticed::Event model.
The Posts table also has many 'notification_mentions', linked through user delegation.

5. MVC Architecture:

The controller, represented by 'application_controller.rb', always sets notifications if the user is authenticated via 'Devise'.
The view, represented by '_notifications.html.erb' file, presents the UI interface (a simple Bootstrap bell badge) and renders
the system encapsulating the business logic.

6. Olive's Framework:

We should further investigate Olive's framework, though I currently lack specific details. Understanding how Olive's framework integrates
with or enhances our existing system could offer valuable insights into our overall architecture and functionality.
Let's explore how Olive's framework interacts with or enhances our current setup.

That summarizes the key aspects of the observed graphics.

If there's more you'd like to discuss about Olive's framework or any other aspect, feel free to share!
