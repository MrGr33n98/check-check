# Missing Models Implementation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of four critical missing models that will complete the Solar Finder platform's core functionality. These models are essential for feature categorization, premium advertising, enterprise management, and user activity tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Feature Group Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to organize product features into logical groups, so that users can better understand and filter products by their capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a feature group THEN the system SHALL store the group name, features array, and categories
2. WHEN an admin assigns features to a group THEN the system SHALL validate feature uniqueness within the group
3. WHEN a user browses products THEN the system SHALL display features organized by their assigned groups
4. WHEN an admin sets a feature group position THEN the system SHALL order groups according to their position value
5. IF a feature group is marked inactive THEN the system SHALL hide it from public display while preserving data

### Requirement 2: Sponsored Plan Management

**User Story:** As a solar company provider, I want to purchase sponsored advertising plans, so that my products get premium visibility and increased lead generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a company member purchases a sponsored plan THEN the system SHALL create a plan record with start and end dates
2. WHEN a sponsored plan is active THEN the system SHALL track impressions and clicks for analytics
3. WHEN a sponsored plan expires THEN the system SHALL automatically deactivate premium placement
4. IF a plan includes custom CTA options THEN the system SHALL allow custom text and URL configuration
5. WHEN users view sponsored content THEN the system SHALL increment impression counters
6. WHEN users click sponsored content THEN the system SHALL increment click counters and track conversion

### Requirement 3: SMP Company Management

**User Story:** As an enterprise solar management platform administrator, I want to manage multiple companies with different subscription plans, so that I can provide tiered services and track usage across organizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an SMP company THEN the system SHALL require company name, plan type, and contact information
2. WHEN assigning domains to a company THEN the system SHALL validate domain format and prevent duplicates
3. WHEN tracking company costs and savings THEN the system SHALL calculate savings percentage automatically
4. IF a company subscription expires THEN the system SHALL restrict access to premium features
5. WHEN managing departments and teams THEN the system SHALL allow array-based organization structure
6. WHEN a company upgrades plans THEN the system SHALL update feature access immediately

### Requirement 4: SMP User Activity Tracking

**User Story:** As an enterprise administrator, I want to track user activity and login patterns within my organization, so that I can monitor engagement and optimize our solar management processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an SMP user logs in THEN the system SHALL record login timestamp and increment login counter
2. WHEN tracking user activity THEN the system SHALL store time spent and activity data in JSON format
3. WHEN a user belongs to a department or team THEN the system SHALL associate them with the correct organizational unit
4. IF a user hasn't logged in for 30 days THEN the system SHALL mark them as inactive for reporting
5. WHEN generating activity reports THEN the system SHALL calculate total time spent and login frequency
6. WHEN linking to main user accounts THEN the system SHALL maintain optional association with the primary User model

### Requirement 5: Model Integration and Relationships

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all new models to integrate seamlessly with existing platform functionality, so that data consistency and business logic remain intact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating model associations THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity with foreign keys
2. WHEN implementing validations THEN the system SHALL prevent invalid data entry and provide clear error messages
3. WHEN adding indexes THEN the system SHALL optimize query performance for array fields and common lookups
4. IF models use enums THEN the system SHALL define clear states and transitions
5. WHEN implementing scopes THEN the system SHALL provide efficient filtering and querying capabilities

### Requirement 6: Administrative Interface

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive admin interfaces for all new models, so that I can manage feature groups, sponsored plans, companies, and users efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing admin interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide full CRUD operations for all models
2. WHEN viewing list pages THEN the system SHALL display key information with proper filtering and search
3. WHEN editing records THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive forms with validation feedback
4. IF working with array fields THEN the system SHALL provide tag-based input interfaces
5. WHEN managing relationships THEN the system SHALL provide dropdown selectors for associated records

### Requirement 7: Data Migration and Seeding

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database migrations and seed data, so that the new models can be deployed safely and tested with realistic data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running migrations THEN the system SHALL create all tables with proper indexes and constraints
2. WHEN seeding data THEN the system SHALL create representative sample records for testing
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL handle migrations without data loss
4. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear rollback procedures
5. WHEN testing locally THEN the system SHALL populate enough data to demonstrate all features

### Requirement 8: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the new models to perform efficiently under load, so that the platform remains responsive as it scales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying array fields THEN the system SHALL use GIN indexes for optimal performance
2. WHEN loading associated records THEN the system SHALL prevent N+1 query problems
3. WHEN calculating aggregates THEN the system SHALL use efficient database operations
4. IF handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and lazy loading
5. WHEN caching is appropriate THEN the system SHALL implement strategic caching for frequently accessed data

### Requirement 9: Security and Authorization

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want proper access controls for all new models, so that sensitive business data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing admin interfaces THEN the system SHALL require proper authentication and authorization
2. WHEN company members access sponsored plans THEN the system SHALL verify they belong to the correct company
3. WHEN SMP users access company data THEN the system SHALL enforce company-level data isolation
4. IF handling financial data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate security measures
5. WHEN logging sensitive operations THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails

### Requirement 10: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive tests for all new models, so that functionality remains reliable and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing models THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all validations and methods
2. WHEN testing associations THEN the system SHALL verify relationship integrity and cascading behavior
3. WHEN testing admin interfaces THEN the system SHALL ensure all CRUD operations work correctly
4. IF testing business logic THEN the system SHALL cover edge cases and error conditions
5. WHEN running test suite THEN the system SHALL maintain fast execution times and clear failure reporting
